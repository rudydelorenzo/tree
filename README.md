## What is tree?
`This repo is part of a 10-minute speed coding challenge`

*tree* is a nodeJS app that takes a directory as input and creates an ascii file tree from it.

The code recursively traverses all the directories it comes across.

This is the basis to create a backend (or frontend) web platform to automatically generate a file tree.
